    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Saurea offers premium biotechnology fermented sauerkraut (fermented cabbage) and sauerspinat (fermented water spinach) made with the best premium ingridients and love 💖. Perfectly crafted for those who want to eat good but still healthy.
    </p>
    <h2> Why Saurea?</h2>
    <p>Saurea is a perfect match for you if you want to eat healthy and enjoy it. We deliver a new taste to you by using water spinach and cabbage as the base ingridient to make the perfect crunchy sauerkraut. We have done testimonials and it has been proven that both produce good results. If you're looking for a more lighter on the sour, more savory but still fresh taste and only a little bit of crunch then out sauerspinat is the one for you. But if you prefer to keep the flavors balanced with savory and sour, sauerkraut would be the perfect match.</p>
    <p>Saurea was inspired by mixing the word "sauer" and "aurea". "Sauer" means sour or acidic and in biotechnology, "sauer" often relates to fermentation such as sauerkraut and sauerspinat. "Aurea" means golden giving it a feel of luxury, beauty, value, and premium products. </p>
